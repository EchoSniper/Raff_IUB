# IoT-Based Distribution System Fault Detection and Monitoring System  
### Final Year Design Project  

This project is designed and developed by our team from **Independent University, Bangladesh** as part of our Final Year Design Project.  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains a set of codes for an **IoT-Based Distribution System Fault Detection and Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi**. The system incorporates:  
- **Real-time Signal Processing**  
- **Localhost Website for Monitoring**  
- **Data Acquisition**  
- And more functionalities aimed at fault detection in distribution systems.  

### Code Origins  
The codes in this repository are a mix of collected, modified, and AI-generated scripts. They are currently in **draft form** and will undergo further analysis, modifications, and detailed commenting for improved understanding and usability in future research and development.  

## Open Source Contribution  
This project is made **open source** to encourage further research and innovation in this field. Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome to use, improve, and build upon this work.
